- Data transfer between servers and between server and storage without the involvement of the host CPU in the data path
- Bandwidth 10 ~ 400 GbE/s (DDR, QDR, FDR, EDR, HDR, NDR)
- RDMA provides low latency through stack bypass and copy avoidance
- Reduces CPU utilization
- Reduces memory bandwidth bottlenecks and provides high bandwidth utilization
- Optimized server utilization with high speed networking and CPU offload
- High availability and high reliability for compute, storage, and network
- Increases total SSD utilization to over 90%
